        <h2 class="normalfw"> <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Pills</strong> <br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</strong> Pretty much the worst kind if HRT, costs are quite high and not effective. It is never recommended to take Testosterone pills. Estrogen pills should also be taken with an anti-androgen (like very low dose cypro, never do spiro).<br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Application:</strong> Estrogen pills should be taken sublingually or buccally. Taking Estrogen pills orally (swalling them) severely decreases their effects. Pills need to be taken at multiple intervals in a day. (For example taking a pill every 6-8 hours)<br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Can be used for monotherapy?:</strong> <br>Estrogen: Not at all <br> Testosterone: Don't even try
