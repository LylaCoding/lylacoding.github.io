        <h1>Blood Testing</h1>
        <h2 class="normalfw">When taking hormones it is important that you are doing regular blood tests. (Usually every
            3-6 months, depending on how long you have been taking hormones for.) <br> <br>This guide will go over, what
            blood tests you should be getting, what target hormone ranges you should look for in your blood tests
            results, where you can get blood tests done, and how taking certain hormones will affect the levels of your
            other hormones</h2>

            <h2>Where can I get blood tests done?
            </h2>
    
            <h2 class="normalfw">Knowing where to get your blood tests done can be tricky as not everyone will have support
                of their doctors when self-medicating. However, there are multiple options available for getting blood
                tests.
                <br><br>
    
                <strong>Your Local GP</strong> <br> If your local GP is supportive of self-medication, they may be able to
                provide you with blood tests. This is the most convenient option as it is free and easier to get your
                results back. <br> There is a crowdsourced list of GPs you can find <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b5SSnb7LBUlWSjasN2ld7qPGmEchgDG8voUY-SkfAlw/edit?gid=0#gid=0">here</a>
                that are Trans+ friendly, where you can search for a GP near you that has a history of performing hormone
                blood tests with comments from people's experiences there. <br> Note: while your doctor may be willing to
                give you a blood test they may not always be willing to interpret the results for you.
                <br><br>
